# Daily Python Progress Tracker

Welcome! This repository is created to track my daily progress in Python — experiments, exercises, notes, and small projects. A simple, honest log of learning by doing.

## Why this repo?
- To document daily practice and measurable progress.  
- To keep snippets, lessons learned, and challenges in one place.  
- To reflect on growth and make it easy to revisit past work.

## What you'll find here
- `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `.py` — daily notes, exercises, or scripts  
- `projects/` — small projects built during practice  
- `snippets/` — reusable code snippets and utilities  
- `resources/` — short references or helpful tips  
- `README.md` — this file

## How I use it
1. Create an entry for each day (markdown and/or code).  
2. Keep entries short and focused: objective, what I tried, what worked, what didn’t, and next steps.  
3. Tag entries with keywords (e.g., `data-science`, `web`, `oop`, `algorithms`) for easy searching.
