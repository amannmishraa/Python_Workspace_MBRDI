# Daily Python Progress Tracker

Welcome! This repository is created to track my daily progress in Python — experiments, exercises, notes, and small projects. A simple, honest log of learning by doing.

## Why this repo?
- To document daily practice and measurable progress.  
- To keep snippets, lessons learned, and challenges in one place.  
- To reflect on growth and make it easy to revisit past work.

## What you'll find here
- `daily/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or `.py` — daily notes, exercises, or scripts  
- `projects/` — small projects built during practice  
- `snippets/` — reusable code snippets and utilities  
- `resources/` — short references or helpful tips  
- `README.md` — this file

## How I use it
1. Create an entry for each day (markdown and/or code).  
2. Keep entries short and focused: objective, what I tried, what worked, what didn’t, and next steps.  
3. Tag entries with keywords (e.g., `data-science`, `web`, `oop`, `algorithms`) for easy searching.


## Tips
- Commit often — a daily snapshot is motivation.  
- Keep experiments in isolated files or folders to avoid clutter.  
- Use branches for larger experiments that might break main progress history.

## Contributing (for future you)
- This is primarily a personal log, but contributions in the form of suggestions, improvements to format, or additional snippets are welcome.  
- Keep changes atomic and include a short note in the commit message about why the change helps your learning.

Use as you like; keep it simple and focused on learning.
